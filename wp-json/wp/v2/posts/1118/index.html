I have \u2013 actually almost every job advert that I come across. These job descriptions can lower your self-esteem and make you feel underqualified, especially if you&#8217;re a fresh graduate or just learning to code.<\/p>\n<p>So, what happens when you don&#8217;t have any work experience in the tech industry and you want to apply for a job?

You just have to use your past projects (and maybe build some new ones) to help you stand out.<\/p>\n<p>In this guide, we will go through how to use experience from your projects to help you with your job applications. Our focus will be on some of the major Python projects that can help boost your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in a job environment.<\/p>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"why-build-projects-in-python\" href=\"#why-build-projects-in-python\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Why Build Projects in Python?<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>You can use Python in many ways, including software and web development, machine learning, data analytics, and more. Knowing Python is a valuable skill for a coder. But if you&#8217;re new to coding, it can be difficult to demonstrate your expertise on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 when you are applying for jobs.<\/p>\n<p>Completing Python projects that you can clearly describe and that a hiring manager can look at is a great way to showcase your skills<\/p>\n<p>If you aren\u2019t sure how to write a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 needs a complete revamp, there are multiple resources online to help you out:<\/p>\n<p>Now, here are some ideas for Python projects that you can showcase on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9.<\/p>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"python-project-ideas\" href=\"#python-project-ideas\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Python Project Ideas<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"1-server-status-checker\" href=\"#1-server-status-checker\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  1. Server Status Checker<br \/>\n<\/h3>\n<p>A server status checker is a script that will let you monitor if your server is active and running. It can show you how much downtime your server has had and give you regular updates of its performance. It&#8217;ll also send immediate alerts when server is down.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the tools that come in handy when developing such a script include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Socket &#8211; helps with connection to different servers.<\/li>\n<li>SSL &#8211; required for wrapping the socket connection.<\/li>\n<li>Date &amp; Time &#8211; Check what time server is active or went down.<\/li>\n<li>smtplib &#8211; Send email alerts when the server is down.<\/li>\n<li>Pickle &#8211; Saves the history of the server performance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Read the rest the article <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freecodecamp.org\/news\/python-project-ideas-to-improve-your-resume\/\">here on freecode camp<\/a> to get to learn on other project ideas and also how to list projects in a resume.<\/p>\n<p>I appreciate your time reading.<\/p>\n<p>Your support will be really appreciated<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.buymeacoffee.com\/lary\"><img src=\"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/practicaldev\/image\/fetch\/s--zQj764Ae--\/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880\/https:\/\/cdn.buymeacoffee.com\/buttons\/default-orange.png\" alt=\"Buy Me A Coffee\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"434\" height=\"100\"\/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Connect With me at <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/larymak1\">Twitter<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/larymak\">GitHub<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCrT1ARRZfLOuf6nc_97eXEg\">YouTube<\/a> | <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/hillary-nyakundi\">LinkedIn<\/a>  | <\/p>\n<p>Enjoy Coding \u2764.<\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/>\n<br \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Every project is an opportunity to learn \u2013 to figure out problems and challenges, and to invent and reinvent.
