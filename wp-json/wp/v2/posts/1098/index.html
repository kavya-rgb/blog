It has made it possible to ship web concepts to other platforms like mobile as desktop. With focus on front end development in JavaScript, libraries like React, Vue.js and Angular have played a great role in UI development and are taking the biggest portion of the Developer base. But this is changing, with new libraries like Svelte JS that are introducing new concepts like compiled frameworks. Speaking of new, <a href=\"https:\/\/orbiton.js.org\">Orbiton JS<\/a> comes into the picture. Its a new JavaScript library for building UI s, dubbed as \u201cThe Ultimate JavaScript library for building User Interfaces\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Orbiton JS began as a rendering engine from the Media JS NPM package that was for using built HTML Media elements in a website. It was originally known as Pearl JS but due to naming conflicts on NPM it was renamed. Orbiton JS being new comes with latest trends in the web development world. It is built with for concepts in mind and these include the Performance, Size, Portability and easy adoption by the community. let me explain them in detail.<\/p>\n<p>Orbiton focuses of Performance mainly, to archive this the core team writes code that tries to utilize minimal memory as possible based on how different JavaScript engines like V8 and Gecko compile and run JavaScript. Orbiton\u2019s one-way data binding also makes sure everything is modular and fast. Although Orbiton JS utilizes the Virtual DOM it, uses an architecture that keeps operations fast to prevent long loops within your application. In an aim to keep performance to the peek, the team is developing a new renderer that is built in Rust and compiled to web Assembly and this will be a game changer and will make performance even greater. <br \/>The Orbiton team Also tries to keep Orbiton at a very small size with the core package plus the DOM renderer at only 11KB which is almost equal to only React&#8217;s core package without ReactDOM which is around 120KB plus. Orbiton achieves this by using clean code and prevents unnecessary operations. When it comes to matters concerning portability, Orbiton\u2019s core packages is written in universal JavaScript that can run in all JavaScript environments be it Node, Deno and in the browser. This makes it possible for you to run Orbiton in any platform and Orbiton has the concept of registering a custom renderer making it possible to ship Orbiton in any other platform like mobile. Orbiton was also built to easily adopt to the JavaScript Ecosystem by making it easy for Orbiton developers to utilize common JavaScript tools like webpack, babel and other tools. To archive this Orbiton has a set of utils like the official babel plugin and an SWC plugin( comming soon ) that transform JSX to Orbiton functions.<\/p>\n<p>Lets also explore some of the amazing features of Orbiton JS. Orbiton JS uses a component based system making code reusable and Building UIs easy. Its is also written in Typescript so has a seem-less integration with typescript making it easy to catch bugs. Orbiton JS is also reactive in nature with features like state and other proposed features like Proxy-binders. Orbiton has also created the Orbiton-server package to enable server side Rendering in Orbiton. The team is also realizing other amazing features in the major release like Fragments, Error boundaries, Context, Suspense, Co-current Rendering, Directives, Lazy Components and Portals. Some special features like Proxy-binders are also going to be introduced<\/p>\n<p>Enough with the talk, lets get into developing something with Orbiton. As I stated Orbiton utilizes JSX so if you are familiar with HTML or JSX itself your are good to go. In order to quickly get started with Orbiton, the team provides a quick start template. Install the template by running these commands in your terminal:<\/p>\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>npx degit Orbitionjs\/template my-app\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode<\/title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"\/>\n<\/svg><\/p>\n<p>    <svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode<\/title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"\/>\n<\/svg><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>then run<\/p>\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code><span class=\"nb\">cd <\/span>my-app\nnpm <span class=\"nb\">install\n<\/span>npm start\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode<\/title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"\/>\n<\/svg><\/p>\n<p>    <svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode<\/title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"\/>\n<\/svg><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Make sure you have node js installed<\/p>\n<p>Your can now go to the index.js file and create an element.

You can visit the <a href=\"https:\/\/orbiton.js.org\/\">Official documentation<\/a> for more on Orbiton JS. Or even you can view its <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Orbitonjs\/orbiton\">Source code on GitHub<\/a>. Lets all show this amazing project support by giving it a <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Orbitonjs\/orbiton\">star on GitHub<\/a> or even possibly supporting its creator on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/jimjunior\">patreon<\/a>. Well that\u2019s all for today.<\/p>\n<hr\/>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: The team behind Orbiton States if clearly that Orbiton will not be production ready only until version 2.0.0 is released otherwise it\u2019s just for development purposes but it can also be used in production though its not encouraged.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In the next article i will be giving you a detailed look into Orbiton with writing some code.<\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The rise of web frameworks has made transformed web development as it was known to be.
