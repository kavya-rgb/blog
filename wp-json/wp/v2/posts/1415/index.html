There are several different types of Channel Names, including a person\u2019s first and last name (Kavya Sahai) and names that describe a channel\u2019s overall topic (DEV.To).<\/p>\n<h4>\n  <a name=\"why-is-your-channel-name-important\" href=\"#why-is-your-channel-name-important\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Why Is Your Channel Name Important?<br \/>\n<\/h4>\n<p>Your Channel Name appears on your videos, your channel page, and in YouTube\u2019s search results.<\/p>\n<p>Your Channel Name also influences people whether they want to subscribe or not. <\/p>\n<p>For Example, You Have Name Like xxx Eduction , and you post Gaming Videos, Most People would not subscribe and If You Have Name Like TECHNOBLADE, because that&#8217;s attractive people might subscribe to your Channel<\/p>\n<h5>\n  <a name=\"how-to-take-a-unique-name\" href=\"#how-to-take-a-unique-name\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  How To Take A UNIQUE Name<br \/>\n<\/h5>\n<p>You Don&#8217;t need any Generators, cuz they are crap, the only thing you need is a outline. <\/p>\n<p>Just Think what your channel is all about, and start thinking some name like If I take education as my keyword, Then MY Name won&#8217;t be like xyz Education rather I would choose CBSE Flourish or something like CBSE Accelerate . <\/p>\n<p>Well, Name sounds good and attractive. <\/p>\n<p>But, I prefer that you should take your name as your channel name, because that would make your name a brand.<\/p>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"channel-icon\" href=\"#channel-icon\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Channel ICON<br \/>\n<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s not only an icon, it describes your channel&#8217;s overall theme to the people and if your icon is good, that would lead in a good number of conversions.<\/p>\n<p>Well, I don&#8217;t have a Channel ICON, because i don&#8217;t spend much time on YouTube, Still I Have over 64K subs.<\/p>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"youtube-channel-art\" href=\"#youtube-channel-art\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  YouTube Channel Art<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>Well, not necessary but it makes you channel a bit boring and cheap headed, so, if you have a channel art, CONJUGATE it with the overall YouTube Channel something like ItzGlimpse<\/p>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"youtube-channel-description\" href=\"#youtube-channel-description\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  YouTube Channel Description<br \/>\n<\/h3>\n<h4>\n  <a name=\"what-is-a-channel-description\" href=\"#what-is-a-channel-description\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  What Is A Channel Description?<br \/>\n<\/h4>\n<p>A Channel Description (also known as a \u201cYouTube About Page\u201d) is a brief outline of what type of content you publish on your channel. It appears on your Channel Page and in YouTube\u2019s search results.<\/p>\n<h4>\n  <a name=\"why-is-it-important\" href=\"#why-is-it-important\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Why Is It Important?<br \/>\n<\/h4>\n<p>It is important because, Your visitors can know more about taking visitors to subscribers and helping conversion.<\/p>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"channel-trailer\" href=\"#channel-trailer\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Channel Trailer<br \/>\n<\/h3>\n<h4>\n  <a name=\"what-is-a-channel-trailer\" href=\"#what-is-a-channel-trailer\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  What Is A Channel Trailer?<br \/>\n<\/h4>\n<p>A Channel Trailer is a video designed to help people quickly learn about a YouTube channel.

Others script out every single word.<\/p>\n<p>No matter where you fall on that spectrum, here are some best practices for planning, outlining and scripting YouTube videos.<\/p>\n<h4>\n  <a name=\"first-45-seconds\" href=\"#first-45-seconds\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  First 45 seconds<br \/>\n<\/h4>\n<p>Everyone says 15 secs, but from my experience I can 45 seconds because, YouTube viewers decide watch or not in 15 seconds and whether to continue or not in 45 seconds.<\/p>\n<p>So, Plan For 45 seconds, not 15 seconds.<\/p>\n<h4>\n  <a name=\"what-to-do-in-15-seconds\" href=\"#what-to-do-in-15-seconds\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  What To Do In 15 Seconds<br \/>\n<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A brief summary of what your video\u2019s about (\u201cToday you\u2019re going to learn\u2026\u201d)<\/li>\n<li>An eye-catching visual<\/li>\n<li>An attention-grabbing line (\u201cI almost died\u2026\u201d)<\/li>\n<li>A teaser for what\u2019s coming up later<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>\n  <a name=\"what-to-do-in-next-45-seconds\" href=\"#what-to-do-in-next-45-seconds\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  What to do in next 45 seconds<br \/>\n<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Attract Viewers and be on the point, don&#8217;t tell them to subscribe until atleast they watched 5 minutes of your video.<\/li>\n<li>If you are a YouTube Shorts One, So, Tell them to like and subscribe after your complete video and it&#8217;s knowledge.<\/li>\n<li>Never Go, Off The Point, This would lead viewers to stop watching your video, because, YouTube has thousands or millions of videos on the same topic. Viewer could watch any other video<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"filming-youtube-videos\" href=\"#filming-youtube-videos\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Filming YouTube Videos<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>I know you all can film a video well and edit it just go to Adobe Premiere Pro docs, if you don&#8217;t know how to edit well.<\/p>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"youtube-video-editing\" href=\"#youtube-video-editing\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  YouTube Video Editing<br \/>\n<\/h3>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve shot your video, it\u2019s time to dive into the editing process. Editing can turn a mediocre video into something truly amazing.<\/p>\n<p>In fact the most popular channels on YouTube almost all use video editing techniques to make their videos shine.<\/p>\n<p>For example, TECHNOBLADE, makes boring Minecraft look fabulous.<\/p>\n<p>Thank God, editing doesn\u2019t have to be hard or complicated. As long as you stick to the techniques outlined here, you\u2019ll be editing like a pro in no time.<\/p>\n<p>You can use Kinemaster and there are tons of tutorial on Kinemaster, so I&#8217;m not gonna waste you time in explaining that.<\/p>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"youtube-cards\" href=\"#youtube-cards\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  YouTube Cards<br \/>\n<\/h3>\n<h4>\n  <a name=\"what-are-youtube-cards\" href=\"#what-are-youtube-cards\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  What are YouTube Cards<br \/>\n<\/h4>\n<p>Cards are interactive elements added to YouTube videos that can be used to promote videos, playlists, websites, merchandise or channels. Unlike annotations (which cards replaced), cards appear on both desktop and mobile.<\/p>\n<p>They generally come with the (i) button on the top right corner of the video.<\/p>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"end-screen\" href=\"#end-screen\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  END SCREEN<br \/>\n<\/h3>\n<p>An End Screen (also referred to as an \u201cEnd Card\u201d or \u201cEndslate\u201d) is a YouTube feature that appears in the last 5-20 seconds of a video. YouTubers can use their end screen to promote videos, playlists, merchandise and external websites.<\/p>\n<p>They can also contain a dialogue box to promote viewers into subscribers by containing a Subscribe Link.<\/p>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"thumbnail\" href=\"#thumbnail\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Thumbnail<br \/>\n<\/h3>\n<p>A thumbnail is a clickable, visual icon that represents the content of a YouTube video. Thumbnails are used on every YouTube video, and are considered a major factor in a video\u2019s click-through-rate and views.<\/p>\n<p>According to YouTube, 90% of top-performing videos use a custom thumbnail. That\u2019s no coincidence.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because YouTube viewers rely on thumbnails to help them decide what videos to watch. In fact, it\u2019s no exaggeration to say that your thumbnail can make or break your entire video.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, making a thumbnail that stands out isn\u2019t easy.<\/p>\n<p>After all, your video is competing with thousands of other videos\u2026 many of which also use custom thumbnails.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where these thumbnail best practices come into play. They\u2019re designed to help you easily create thumbnails that get noticed and clicked on.<\/p>\n<h4>\n  <a name=\"how-to-choose-a-good-thumbnail\" href=\"#how-to-choose-a-good-thumbnail\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  How To Choose a Good Thumbnail<br \/>\n<\/h4>\n<p>There&#8217;s no ninja technique of making Good thumbnails, you only need Experience<\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>YouTube Gets more than 100 Billion Videos posted every month.
