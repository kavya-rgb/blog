Solid is reactive and directly updates the DOM (without virtual DOM). The render function is only called once, even if the state changes, and there are no stale closure issues. A good article to discover the differences between these 2 frameworks and discover Solid.<\/p>\n<p>I find Solid really interesting. In the short term it can be a very good alternative to React for web apps. However, I am waiting to see the practical use of the innovations of React 18 because I think that the virtual DOM is interesting for the highly anticipated concurrent features.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@nirbenyair\/headless-components-in-react-and-why-i-stopped-using-ui-libraries-a8208197c268?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\"><strong>Headless components in React and why I stopped using a UI library for our design system<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Nir tells his story: from using React-Bootstrap and MUI to implementing an autocomplete from scratch, to ending up using a headless lib that encapsulates behavior and accessibility.
