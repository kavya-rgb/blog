I don\u2019t even have energy to study and when I do have time I just can\u2019t grasp the math of it .The only issue is my math courses I\u2019m the worst math student you can ever think of. I study for hours and just don\u2019t get it. But I love programming, the things I\u2019ve tried come naturally to me. When I struggle I have fun with the struggle. I\u2019m really debating doing a boot camp instead of college because I know I won\u2019t be able to pass a computer science degree because of the math. But I don\u2019t know what to do because I\u2019m scared of the risk of dropping out and trying a boot camp. Don\u2019t get me wrong I know a college grad with a cs degree has more opportunities than me when it comes to jobs. But I hope to make up with it through projects. Essentially what I want to know if anyone has experience being self taught or going to a boot camp. I will love to talk to anyone that has done this for web development.<\/p>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So I\u2019m currently doing a computer science degree and I\u2019m just so stressed and tried and exhausted from it.I wake up early to go to school then go straight to work then don\u2019t get home until 10 and do this day after day.
