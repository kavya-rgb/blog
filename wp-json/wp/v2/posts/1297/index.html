She was the type of client that would ignore hosting bills until I&#8217;d send a &#8220;Please pay to avoid interruption&#8221; notice. So weird how that would always prompt a response. Unfortunately, it was always a &#8220;xyz image needs to be updated&#8221; or &#8220;Why am I getting so much spam!?!&#8221;. <\/p>\n<p>I made the mistake of allowing her bills to go unpaid for far too long. I ran a statement report on her account. THIRTY months behind. I can&#8217;t believe I managed to let something like this happen. Either way, I sent her the report. Days later; nothing. Weeks; nothing. A couple moths later, I pulled the plug on the sites I hosted for her. <\/p>\n<p>Friday morning, she went berserk! She didn&#8217;t bother calling my phone, or sending a text, or reaching out on Slack. She first called the company I work for, (which is very much unrelated to my web services biz), cursing out the receptions, who had absolutely no idea WTF this lunatic was talking about. The receptionist in question is a badass, no-bullshit gatekeeper. No skin off her nose, but she was agitated to say the least.  <\/p>\n<p>When that didn&#8217;t work, she called my business partner. Yet another completely unrelated business. However, I shared a few fun stories with him, over the years, so he knew who she was. He sends me a message letting me know she&#8217;s trying to get in touch and she&#8217;s losing her GD mind, demanding I call her back. To which he probably laughed at because A: He knows how I operate at my main gig and B: Gator don&#8217;t play no shit! She finally decided to use conventional means of communication; Slack. <\/p>\n<p>Oh, she also managed to find my insta account, and posted a crazed comment on the last image I shared (A 12 year old bottle of Macallan that I got from a buddy). I didn&#8217;t notice this until today, which prompted the rant \ud83d\ude1b<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t bother going into the insane messages I received from her, but she proceeded to tell me how it&#8217;s illegal to &#8220;hold her sites hostage&#8221; and that &#8220;I don&#8217;t own the content&#8221;, despite her balance. Someone should tell the phone company! I gave her until the end of the month to find new hosting. I&#8217;m so excited for her to find out how much it&#8217;s going actually cost her to keep her sites running elsewhere.<\/p>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last week, after finally getting sick of being a nice guy, I pulled the plug on the WORST client&#8217;s websites last Thursday.
