The code above is written in that style. <br \/>Now, this approach uses <code>min-width<\/code> breakpoints. This technique is also used in popular CSS frameworks like <a href=\"https:\/\/getbootstrap.com\/\">Bootstrap<\/a> and sites like <a href=\"https:\/\/css-tricks.com\/\">CSSTricks<\/a><\/p>\n<p>So it is in my opinion a subjective thing. You could follow either mobile first approach or desktop first. <\/p>\n<p>However, I have experienced that while writing in mobile first style the lines of code decreases and most of the time we don&#8217;t have to write extra code for wider screens.<\/p>\n<p>A cool tip: <br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/i.giphy.com\/media\/j71jgpKmLFOChFnEBi\/giphy.gif\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https:\/\/i.giphy.com\/media\/j71jgpKmLFOChFnEBi\/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Tip\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" data-animated=\"true\"\/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Try to use <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Learn\/CSS\/Building_blocks\/Values_and_units#Relative_length_units\">relative units<\/a> while defining or setting any kind of property in CSS.<\/p>\n<p>This helps in giving control back to the user and increase their use experience.<\/p>\n<p>Do you have any thoughts on this?
