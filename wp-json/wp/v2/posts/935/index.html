Even if you take the teacher out of the classroom, I still enjoy sharing interesting ideas and concepts with anyone who will listen.<\/p>\n<h2>\n<p>  My biggest technical achievements are\u2026<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>On a professional level, I&#8217;m proud to have progressed to the point in my career where I&#8217;m known as a great problem solver. Many coworkers have told me that I&#8217;m great at being thrown into problems and coming up with creative solutions rather than just coding them up. I&#8217;ve also had many former teammates and even managers tell me that they learned a lot from working with me. I&#8217;m humbled to know that there are many people who would gladly work with me again (and have even tried to drag me to their jobs with them)!<\/p>\n<h2>\n<p>  I pledge to break the bias in tech by\u2026<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>I try not only to shine as brightly as I can in the tech industry, but also to help other women I meet shine as well. When people assume that women aren&#8217;t technical or that they can&#8217;t work at the same level as men in the same settings, I believe they&#8217;re missing out on the creativity, intelligence, and empathy that their products and teams can have. It&#8217;s not always easy to demonstrate this, but by continuing to do so, whether through my own work or by highlighting the work of other women, I&#8217;m helping to improve the tech industry as a whole.<\/p>\n<h2>\n<p>  I\u2019m excited about\u2026<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m about to embark on my first-ever digital nomad journey. I&#8217;m looking forward to the challenge of traveling and working in different countries. Also, a chance to start a van life and adapt to a new way of life.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you to DEV and GitHub for their generous donations for #SheCoded posts! Let us continue to create opportunities for and support women and girls in technology.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>Happy Coding !!\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My biggest technical goals are\u2026 continuing to develop my systems thinking I want to broaden my toolkit of problem-solving approaches and approach issues from a variety of informed perspectives before implementing a solution.
