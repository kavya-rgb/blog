I was running the tests, seeing them fail, and just trying to edit my code over and over until the tests finally passed. This meant I was coding without actually digging into why my code was wrong and checking what it was that my failing code was actually doing in the background. <\/p>\n<p>So now, I am constantly placing console.log(s) throughout my code, and seeing what pops up in the console in dev tools. I also downloaded the Live Server extension so I can get immediate feedback. <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m basically going on this rant because the reason I discovered that I needed this was through fetch requests. Even though I understood fetch requests, I could not wrap my head around how to get the data I was fetching to appear on the page. And the first thing that really helped me to understand this was to console.log() my fetch and see that data in the console, and then get it to appear on the page, and that is when it really clicked.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Background:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think should probably explain what a fetch request is for the sake of this blog, so here you go:<\/p>\n<p><em>Note: I recently was working on a project where I used the Studio Ghibli API to display a list of Studio Ghibli films in the browser, so I will be using references from this project.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The fetch() function in Javascript is used to make a request to the server to retrieve data and display that data in the browser. <\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a global method on the window object. That means you can use it simply by calling fetch() and passing in a path to a resource as an argument. The request can be used on any API that returns the data in either JSON or XML format. <\/p>\n<p>When using a fetch request you only need one parameter, as opposed to other requests, because fetch defaults to send an HTTP <strong>GET<\/strong> request. Fetch instantaneously returns a promise object. The three promise object statuses are pending, fulfilled, and rejected. To use the data that is returned by the fetch(), and see it in the browser, we need to chain on the then() method which will keep fetching until the status of the request is &#8220;fulfilled&#8221;. We can see what this looks like below:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 1:<\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>function getFilms() {\nfetch('https:\/\/ghibliapi.herokuapp.com\/films')\n  .then(res =&gt; res.json())\n  .then(data =&gt; {\n    console.log(data);\n  })\n}\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode<\/title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"\/>\n<\/svg><\/p>\n<p>    <svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode<\/title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"\/>\n<\/svg><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Notice the console log! If you are coding along open up your file in the browser, open up dev tools, and take a look at what is being logged to the console. It&#8217;s an array of 22 objects! For me seeing this is so satisfying. It&#8217;s telling me I am doing the right thing, I am on right the path, and I actually know what I am doing. I think this is so important, especially when you are learning something new at a quick pace as a means to stop self doubt from taking over. <\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what that data looks like in the console:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/practicaldev\/image\/fetch\/s--m-7oMdlt--\/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880\/https:\/\/dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\/uploads\/articles\/93odhb82iaj3x0umhyob.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/practicaldev\/image\/fetch\/s--m-7oMdlt--\/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880\/https:\/\/dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\/uploads\/articles\/93odhb82iaj3x0umhyob.png\" alt=\"Image description\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"822\" height=\"798\"\/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 2:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ok great! So now that we have seen our data, we need to get our data on the page. In order to do this we need to decide where we want to attach our data to. For this project I had an ul in my index.html file (here&#8217;s a snippet of that code for reference)<\/p>\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code> &lt;div id=\"main\"&gt;\n      &lt;ul id=\"film-list\"&gt;&lt;\/ul&gt;\n      &lt;div id=\"info\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;\/div&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode<\/title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"\/>\n<\/svg><\/p>\n<p>    <svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode<\/title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"\/>\n<\/svg><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>and decided I would attach the films to the ul in order to have them display in the browser. But, in order to put them in the unordered list I need to create li&#8217;s, iterate over the li&#8217;s to attach each object in the array to, and ultimately display them in the browser.<\/p>\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>function getFilms() {\n  const ul = document.getElementById('film-list')\n  fetch('https:\/\/ghibliapi.herokuapp.com\/films')\n  .then(res =&gt; res.json())\n  .then(data =&gt; {\n    data.forEach(film =&gt; {\n      ul.innerHTML += `\n      &lt;li&gt;${film.title}&lt;\/li&gt;\n      `\n    })\n  })\n}\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode<\/title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"\/>\n<\/svg><\/p>\n<p>    <svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode<\/title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"\/>\n<\/svg><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how they show up in the browser: <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/practicaldev\/image\/fetch\/s--4b5YBKH_--\/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880\/https:\/\/dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\/uploads\/articles\/9y3u5x420yipykv5t86g.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/practicaldev\/image\/fetch\/s--4b5YBKH_--\/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880\/https:\/\/dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\/uploads\/articles\/9y3u5x420yipykv5t86g.png\" alt=\"Image description\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"634\" height=\"1030\"\/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sharing this because for whatever reason it took so long for me to realize how important something as simple as a console.log() is in regards to your learning.
