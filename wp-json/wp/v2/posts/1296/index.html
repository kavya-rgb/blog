I started my current company in January with the title of Front End Developer. I&#8217;m the only full time dev at the company and we outsource all of our back end development  another company. When interviewing I was had the understanding that I would be given mockups and build pages and stuff based on those but I have a feeling I&#8217;m being taken advantage of since I have a background in graphic design. My responsibilities now are front end dev, web design, graphic design and what feel like &#8220;lead&#8221; front end developer since as of Monday I&#8217;m being told I have to check the site regularly to make sure nothing is broken.<\/p>\n<p>Wen interviewing originally with the recruiter I was told I&#8217;d be at 75k with a possibility of being a creative director down the road but then in my in person interview with the ceo I was told 80k but then after I did my test I got an offer for 64k.<\/p>\n<p>My 3 month review is in 2ish weeks and I&#8217;m not sure how to approach any of this. On one hand I would like to ask for a raise or to be considered for creative director since I&#8217;m covering so many things but I&#8217;m also kinda nervous because of my imposter syndrome since I&#8217;m working with a language I&#8217;m still pretty new at. I drive about three hours \/ 120 miles a day a day round trip for this job and with gas prices going up its getting a little expensive.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure what to do. I can&#8217;t find another company since my last job and this one are both less than a year it looks like I job hop alot. I like the company and everyone I work with for the most part but I just feel like I&#8217;m being taken advantage of a little bit. Any advice is welcome!<\/p>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Background: I have 8ish years off and on of graphic design experience and about a year and some change of limited web dev experience.
