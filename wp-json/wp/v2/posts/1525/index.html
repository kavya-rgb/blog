Today, you&#8217;ll discover how to distribute your PWA to app stores and the benefits in doing so.<\/p>\n<hr\/>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"why-app-stores\" href=\"#why-app-stores\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Why App Stores?<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>When I talk about publishing PWAs to app stores, devs often ask, &#8220;Why? Isn&#8217;t the point of PWAs that you don&#8217;t need an app store?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And they&#8217;re right, you don&#8217;t <em>need<\/em> app stores. A great benefit of the web is there are no gatekeepers: you can publish your app without needing anyone&#8217;s permission. Your app is truly your own, and you don&#8217;t have to wait for app reviews to submit your app, add features to your app, or fix bugs. You don&#8217;t have to share 30% of your app revenue with the app store.<\/p>\n<p>But app stores have their benefits too. Since the mobile computing explosion of the early 2000s, <strong>we&#8217;ve trained a generation of users to look for apps in app stores.<\/strong> And since Progressive Web Apps are, well, <em>apps<\/em>, why not list your app in the places where users go looking for apps? Your PWA becomes more discoverable &#8212; and your app gains more users &#8212; when you publish to app stores. <\/p>\n<p>Your PWA will be easier to install. While users can add your PWA to homescreen or install from the browser, many non-technical users are unfamiliar with these tasks. Publishing your PWA to app stores lets users find and install your app using their normal workflow: app store \u27a1 search \u27a1 install. <\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll get better engagement from users as your app tile appears where users are looking: in their Start Menu and Taskbar (Windows), Dock (Mac), and home screen (Android and iOS).<\/p>\n<p>Users will be more likely to trust your app. An additional level of safety and security comes with apps that have gone through app store review processes.<\/p>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"distribution-model\" href=\"#distribution-model\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Distribution model<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>Hopefully, I&#8217;ve piqued your interest in getting your PWA published to app stores. <\/p>\n<p>To publish, you&#8217;ll follow three steps:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create an app package for the app store<\/li>\n<li>Register for a developer account for the app store<\/li>\n<li>Submit your app package for review<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"1-create-an-app-package\" href=\"#1-create-an-app-package\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  1. Create an app package<br \/>\n<\/h3>\n<p>In an ideal world, you&#8217;d submit your PWA&#8217;s URL to the app store(s), and they&#8217;d publish your app. <\/p>\n<p>But currently, app stores don&#8217;t support PWAs natively. Instead, app stores require you to wrap your PWA in app packaging, making it look like a native app:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>An <code>.msix<\/code> package (Windows)<\/li>\n<li>An <code>.aab<\/code> package (Android)<\/li>\n<li>An <code>.app<\/code> archive (iOS and Mac)<\/li>\n<li>An <code>.apk<\/code> package (Oculus, Samsung, Amazon)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Fortunately, there are free developer tools that create these app packages for you. Microsoft&#8217;s free and open source <a href=\"https:\/\/aka.ms\/learn-pwa\/30days-4.3\/pwabuilder.com\">PWABuilder<\/a> is such a tool. With PWABuilder, you input your PWA&#8217;s URL, and PWABuilder will generate app packages for your desired app stores.<\/p>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"2-register-for-a-developer-account\" href=\"#2-register-for-a-developer-account\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  2. Register for a developer account<br \/>\n<\/h3>\n<p>Once you generate your app package, you&#8217;ll need to create a developer account in order to submit your PWA for app store review:<\/p>\n<p>While all these app stores support PWAs in some form, know that Microsoft, Android, and Amazon support PWAs the best:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Windows has first-class support for Store PWAs through <a href=\"https:\/\/aka.ms\/learn-pwa\/30days-4.3\/blogs.windows.com\/windowsdeveloper\/2020\/03\/19\/hosted-app-model\">Hosted App Model<\/a>, where your PWA is hosted by Chromium-based Edge.<\/li>\n<li>Android has first-class support for Store PWAs through <a href=\"https:\/\/aka.ms\/learn-pwa\/30days-4.3\/developer.chrome.com\/docs\/android\/trusted-web-activity\">Trusted Web Activity<\/a>, where your PWA is powered by Chrome.<\/li>\n<li>Amazon&#8217;s App Store has improved support for Store PWAs, allowing you to submit your URL directly to the store, which is then powered by a web view when run on Amazon devices.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The other app stores and platforms tend to have lesser support for PWAs, usually involving a native app wrapping a web view with some PWA functionality available. Consider, for example, that publishing a PWA on iOS won&#8217;t have Push Notifications available, because iOS and mobile Safari don&#8217;t currently support the web standard for push notifications. <\/p>\n<p>The gap is closing, however, as platforms evolve and continue to improve their support for web technology. <\/p>\n<p>In the future, we expect to see first-class support for PWAs in all the major app stores. Even as it stands today, your PWA will run on all platforms, and as long as you progressively enhance to use PWA features, your app will light up as platforms support more PWA functionality.<\/p>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"3-submit-your-app-package-for-review\" href=\"#3-submit-your-app-package-for-review\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  3. Submit your app package for review<br \/>\n<\/h3>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve registered with the app store&#8217;s developer program, submit your app for review through the developer portal.<\/p>\n<p>Once you submit your app package, it&#8217;s treated like any other app: app store reviewers will inspect your app and, once approved, your app will be published in the app stores of your choosing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Subsequent updates of your PWA don&#8217;t need to be published through the Store<\/strong>. Since your PWA loads its asssets dynamically, any features or bug fixes you push to your web server will <em>automatically be reflected in your app in the Store<\/em>. Typically, you&#8217;d only need to update your app store package if changing things like app icons, app name, description, screenshots, or other metadata about your app.<\/p>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"lets-publish-a-pwa-to-an-app-store\" href=\"#lets-publish-a-pwa-to-an-app-store\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Let&#8217;s publish a PWA to an app store<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>Go to <a href=\"https:\/\/aka.ms\/learn-pwa\/30days-4.3\/pwabuilder.com\">PWABuilder.com<\/a> and input the URL to your PWA.
