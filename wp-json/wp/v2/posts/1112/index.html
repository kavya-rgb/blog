Alex discusses the consistency and predictability in the design of DynamoDB\u2019s performance, and how to best utilize it.  <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cI think the most important thing to know about Dynamo, it has that primary key structure that we talked about, but every single item is going to have what&#8217;s called a partition key, and what this partition key is doing is basically helping decide to which shard or node, a particular item is going to go to. So when a request comes into DynamoDB, the first thing that&#8217;s going to hit is just this global request router that&#8217;s deployed across the entire region. It handles all the tables within a particular region, and it gets that item, it pulls up the metadata for that table, it hashes the partition key value that was sent in for a particular item, and then based on that, it knows which node to go to in the fleet.\u201d <br \/>&#8211;Alex DeBrie, Principal at DeBrie Advisory and Author of \u201cThe DynamoDB Book.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"time-stamps\" href=\"#time-stamps\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Time Stamps<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>(01:50) DynamoDB scale cases<\/li>\n<li>(05:49) The architecture of DynamoDB that allows it to theoretically scale<\/li>\n<li>(09:37) The top three tips for DynamoDB customers<\/li>\n<li>(11:51) The value of doing the math for your application<\/li>\n<li>(13:14) What mistakes to avoid to keep your costs low<\/li>\n<li>(16:28) Examples of managing costs with DynamoDB\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"sponsor\" href=\"#sponsor\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Sponsor<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>This podcast is presented by <a href=\"https:\/\/cloudfix.com\/\">Cloudfix<\/a>.
