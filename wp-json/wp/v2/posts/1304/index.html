And the databases are not included.<\/p>\n<p>The office has a network drive that I can access from home. I could store local builds there, but I cannot *run* local builds directly from there because its much too slow. So if I store local builds there I&#8217;d still need to copy the files from there to my local machine (still slow), and I&#8217;d also need to periodically export the database to those folders? Just doesn&#8217;t seem clean or feasible.<\/p>\n<p>I am fully willing to ditch MAMP and WAMP for any other kind of local dev tool if some sort of virtual-machine-situation like Vagrant would help solve this problem, I just don&#8217;t have experience in that to know if it would be a help in some way.<\/p>\n<p>Does anyone have experience with this?<\/p>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My office is hybrid.
