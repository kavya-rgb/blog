Small decisions such as what type of variable to use, which programming language construct to use, how to name variables, methods, functions, classes, packages, and so on are a part of the driver&#8217;s role. <em>The driver usually explains to the navigator what they are doing at all times.<\/em> The purpose is dual: to clarify to themselves that they are doing the right thing and to explain to the driver what their intentions are. &#8220;<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;usually explains&#8221; part is genius. I have assumed that a person I am pair programming with is a seasoned Java dev. However, when I asked him to start talking through his coding steps, I have realized that we have to start again from Java basics. That is totally my mistake as instead of listening to the developer I was literally telling him which buttons to press.<\/p>\n<p>Many thanks to Adrian Bolboac\u0103 and Bruno Souza for their ideas on pair programming and sharing.<\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I am reading &#8220;Practical Remote Pair Programming: Best practices, tips, and techniques for collaborating productively with distributed development teams&#8221; (https:\/\/lnkd.in\/e9-uCdt4) Apparently, I was misunderstanding a vital point of pair programming. &#8220;The driver is the one who will have their hands on the keyboard and be writing the code.
