I have seen a couple of very similar requests (I think) on here and @creedon has been successful in nearly all of them.

I would like the &#8220;add to cart&#8221; button (which I have customized to be &#8220;Add to Quote and Continue&#8221;), aside from adding the item to the cart, to return the user to the products page\/previous page and replace the image of the item that was selected with another (to indicate that it has already been chosen). <\/p>\n<p>The first problem: squarespace won&#8217;t let me edit this particular button&#8211;so I think I need to inject code, but I don&#8217;t know how or where.<\/p>\n<p>The second problem: I don&#8217;t even really know how to search for the answer, I don&#8217;t know what this functionality is called. <\/p>\n<p>Two things: 1.) I know enough about code to know how to explain what I want and how to follow directions&#8230;that&#8217;s it though. 2.)
