For example, if you have a wallet class, that class should only implement wallet functionality. It\u2019s fine to call other functionality, but it shouldn\u2019t be written there.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at a bad example. In the code below, the Car class has a single method; start. When this method is called the car may or may not start, depending on some logic which isn\u2019t included here as it\u2019s not important. The class will then log some information depending on the outcome. But notice how the logging functionality is implemented as a method of this class:<\/p>\n<p>This violates the single responsibility principle, because the logic for logging the information should not be a responsibility of the Car class.<\/p>\n<p>There are a number of readability and code management issues that are caused by this, but the easiest issue to describe is actually refactoring.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say your logger logs to a file, and this works great for several months. Suddenly, an update occurs on the underlying system that the car class is running on, and you need to change the way you write to files. Suddenly you now need to update every file writing instance of every class you\u2019ve ever implemented a logger inside of. The task would be huge! But what if you\u2019d followed the single responsibility principle?<\/p>\n<p>As you can see here, we wouldn\u2019t have this problem. The logger is stored in a separate class, which means its functionality is separate to the Car class. The Car class can be changed, moved around or even deleted without affecting the logger class. Likewise, if a change is required to the logger class, it only needs to be carried out in a single place.<\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The single responsibility principle says that a class or module should have only a single purpose.
