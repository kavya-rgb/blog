The company had a positive culture at the beginning, which created a solid foundation for us. As we grew, however, we also had to put a lot of thought into growing and expanding that culture, and adding more inclusive elements. Here are a couple of the challenges we faced, and some of my thoughts as we went through them.<\/p>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"women-in-tech\" href=\"#women-in-tech\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  \u2640\ufe0f Women in Tech \u2640\ufe0f<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>Our company was very diverse overall, but still only had ~5 female developers when I left. I was asked several times by our recruiters for tips on how they could attract more female developers. I don&#8217;t have a lot of advice here! I&#8217;m just a normal person. Things that are important to me in a company are things that I want to believe everyone wants: plenty of paid sick days and vacation, good medical benefits, an inclusive company culture, great people to work with.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, I <em>loved<\/em> working with other women in tech. We had a women in developer monthly lunch club, and a slack channel where we could support each other. We also had a company-wide women&#8217;s channel and another monthly meet-up for that group. Those events were sometimes the highlight of my month, and made me feel much closer and connected to my colleagues, especially in a remote workplace.<\/p>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"pride-amp-diversity\" href=\"#pride-amp-diversity\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 Pride &amp; Diversity \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>Many of your colleagues may identify with a minority community, but they are <em>not<\/em> responsible for educating you or the rest of the company about it. Asking people to tell their story publicly is an extraordinarily personal, and in some case invasive, request.<\/p>\n<p>If you would like someone to talk to your company about inclusivity, consider options such as specifically reaching out to colleagues who regularly talk openly about the topic; paying a speaker; or even asking <em>all<\/em> employees to share related experiences and resources (YMMV).<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, remember that not everyone wants to talk about their gender, sexuality or culture at work. Make assumptions as little as possible. You don&#8217;t need to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JoAnnaScience\/status\/1498379199446278148\">express an opinion on everything<\/a>. And listen to your colleagues if they are telling you that the way you&#8217;re trying to help is actually harming.<\/p>\n<hr\/>\n<p>I wrote this post to contribute to dev.to&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.to\/shecoded\"><em>Nevertheless, She Coded<\/em><\/a> initiative for 2022.
