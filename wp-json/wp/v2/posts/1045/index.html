Well what happens in HTTP is that a connection is established and once the request result process is completed, the connection is terminated.<br \/>So if we use this process for real time messaging, it would take some time to create new connections, thus making our chatting process slower. No one would like that, right?<\/p>\n<p>This is where Web Sockets come in. The major difference is that the connection once established, is not destroyed until there is no more need for it. <\/p>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"pipelines-in-web-sockets\" href=\"#pipelines-in-web-sockets\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Pipelines in Web Sockets<br \/>\n<\/h3>\n<p>This might feel like one of those tech terminologies which scare us. But in simpler terms, pipelines in tech are same as real life pipelines. A connection through which things can be passed in any direction easily. <br \/>This is how Web Sockets work, through pipelines.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/practicaldev\/image\/fetch\/s--bgm-Rxsy--\/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880\/https:\/\/dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\/uploads\/articles\/j7rzkaxcy9syusdtbpdb.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/practicaldev\/image\/fetch\/s--bgm-Rxsy--\/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880\/https:\/\/dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\/uploads\/articles\/j7rzkaxcy9syusdtbpdb.png\" alt=\"How web sockets work\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"\/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>There are many libraries that help with the implementation of Web Sockets like Socket.io<\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We all have used Instagram or WhatsApp to have a healthy chat with our friends.
