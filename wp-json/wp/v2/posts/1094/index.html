Whether you\u2019re a beginner or a seasoned veteran, eventually you\u2019re going to have to find something in a larger data set. But when iterating (looping) through something, you might find yourself a little lost with all of the options available to you. So here\u2019s a quick breakdown of the main ones.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> This isn\u2019t a beginner&#8217;s introduction to how <code>for<\/code> loops work, but rather a comparison of the <code>for<\/code> loop options available.<\/p>\n<p><code>for<\/code> is by far the most common loop. It isn\u2019t specific to arrays or objects (or to any data structure in fact), and can be combined with almost anything to create powerful and fast loops, so long as you configure them properly. Here\u2019s a classic <code>for<\/code> loop in action:<\/p>\n<p><code>for<\/code> loops can be used in conjunction with <code>break<\/code>, <code>continue<\/code> or <code>return<\/code> to create some seriously versatile functionality.<\/p>\n<p><code>forEach<\/code> allows you to return an entire entry from an array. It\u2019s simple and straightforward, but doesn\u2019t come with the additional <code>break<\/code>, <code>continue<\/code> and <code>return<\/code> functionality found with a classic <code>for<\/code> loop. It does however, look incredibly clean.<\/p>\n<p>Think of a <code>forEach<\/code> loop as being like a cleaner, array-specific <code>for<\/code> loop.<\/p>\n<p>The <code>for...in<\/code> loop allows you to loop through the enumerable <strong>properties<\/strong> of an object, including those set by the parent prototype (if one is present).<\/p>\n<p>Now unfortunately, that\u2019s probably not what you want. You could put a check in on each iteration to see if the property belongs to the object or its prototype (<code>hasOwnProperty<\/code> would be perfect here), but that really damages readability. In addition, <code>for...in<\/code> loops only return strings, so if you\u2019re looping through an array (which does, despite the mention of properties above, work), you probably don\u2019t want to use one of these.<\/p>\n<p><code>for\u2026of<\/code> iterates over any enumerable object, won\u2019t convert the values it finds, and does so whilst supporting the functionality of <code>break<\/code>, <code>continue<\/code> and <code>return<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>Think of <code>for...of<\/code> as being like a cleaner version of the <code>for<\/code> loop, specifically for iterable objects, without losing any of the <code>for<\/code> loop\u2019s functionality.<\/p>\n<p>One consistent downside of the above <code>for<\/code> loops is that their compatibility with objects vary. That all changes however, with the use of the <code>Object<\/code> class.<\/p>\n<p>By using <code>Object<\/code>, we can convert our objects to arrays (I promise that\u2019ll make sense shortly), and then loop through those arrays with all of the above loops.<\/p>\n<p>Now, you\u2019ll commonly see <code>forEach<\/code> used in conjunction with this method, but the problem with that is that you lose the ability to <code>break<\/code>, <code>continue<\/code> or <code>return<\/code> during the loop. For that reason, I\u2019d recommend considering a classic <code>for<\/code> loop in conjunction with this method, but here\u2019s an example of both for completeness (note that this example uses <code>Object.keys()<\/code>, which is covered below):<\/p>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"objectkeys\" href=\"#objectkeys\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Object.keys()<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>This handy function returns an array of keys found in the specified object. Even more handily, it only includes keys belonging to the immediate object, and not its prototype, so that means no more seeing the parent props like we do with <code>for...in<\/code>.<\/p>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"objectentries\" href=\"#objectentries\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Object.entries()<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>This one returns each and every entry in its entirety, including both the property and value. This can be more helpful if you want to retain the key that you\u2019re seeing the value of (which you often do).<\/p>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"objectvalues\" href=\"#objectvalues\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Object.values()<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>As the name suggests, this method returns only the values found in an object. No index, no key, just values.<\/p>\n<p>You might have reached this point and be hoping for me to say \u201cSo make sure kids, that you always use the <em>best<\/em> loop, the \u201d.<\/p>\n<p>But c\u2019mon, that\u2019s rarely how programming works.<\/p>\n<p>In reality, the right approach for you depends entirely on the context. Some of the above methods are faster than others, some are more useful, others are more readable. It\u2019s up to you to find the right combination of the above, but hopefully this has helped you on your way to making that decision.<\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Iterating over objects and arrays is something every developer has to do.
