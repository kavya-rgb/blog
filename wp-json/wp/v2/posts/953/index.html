The people you have eavesdropped on are actually discussing two professions that, despite having been around for decades, and in theory for centuries, have been defined by the tech industry as UX and UI design.<br \/>UX design refers to the term \u201cuser experience design\u201d, while UI stands for \u201cuser interface design\u201d. Both elements are crucial to a product and work closely together. But despite their professional relationship, the roles themselves are quite different, referring to very different aspects of the product development process and the design discipline.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are similarities between product designer and UI\/UX Designer ?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>both designers will go through the design thinking process and maintain a human-centered approach when it comes to design. Both have a market research aspect to their job (although naturally, the UX designer will dive deeper into the user testing)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Differences<\/strong><br \/>UI\/UX designers and product designers have a fair few differences in their job specs.<br \/>One of the best ways to distinguish between a UX designer and a product designer is the questions they ask.<\/p>\n<p>for example <br \/>While a UX designer might ask:<br \/><em>&#8220;Is this product easy to use?&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>A product designer might ask:<br \/><em>&#8220;Does this fit well with the needs of the business as well?&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I think you get the right answer through this aricle, share it on all your socials.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You can connect me here!<\/strong><br \/>Devendra A.
