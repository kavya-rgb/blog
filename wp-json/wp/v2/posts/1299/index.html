Curious, I asked her what provider she used to get her domain and build the website. She said GoDaddy. I sighed in disappointment wishing she would have consulted me before building her website.<\/p>\n<p>The main thing GoDaddy has going for it is its marketing which unsuspecting people fall victim to, believing it\u2019s a good domain registrar and web hosting provider.<\/p>\n<p>The truth is, GoDaddy leverages their successful marketing in order to upcharge for their services and profit.<\/p>\n<p>Even upon checkout, GoDaddy tries to upsell you on services like:<\/p>\n<p>* Domain Protection<br \/>\n* Website Builder<br \/>\n* SSL Certificate<br \/>\n* Microsoft Office 365<br \/>\n* Google Email<\/p>\n<p>Many of these services (like SSL certificates) can be gotten for free.<\/p>\n<p>For the other services like Office 365 and a Google Business email, it&#8217;ll be presented as **FREE** but if you read the fine print, you&#8217;ll see it&#8217;s only free for the first year, then they&#8217;ll hit you with an overcharged monthly subscription fee.<\/p>\n<p># Domain Registration<\/p>\n<p>For example, the introductory price for a GoDaddy .com domain costs $12 for two years (which is already high for an introductory price). What people don\u2019t realize though is that after two years, the cost jumps to $20\/yr.<\/p>\n<p>This is absolutely ridiculous&#8230; You can get a .com domain for $10\/yr with a domain registrar like Namesilo saving you 50% a year. Porkbun is also a great option with .com domains.<\/p>\n<p>With Namecheap you can get a .com domain with an introductory rate of $9, however, the renewal rate is $14\/yr.<\/p>\n<p>Namesilo is cheaper than Namecheap, Namecheap does have a better user interface for managing your domains. Namesilo\u2019s backend looks more archaic.<\/p>\n<p># Web Hosting<\/p>\n<p>Instead of buying your domain and web hosting directly from GoDaddy. It\u2019s actually better to buy your domain separately from a domain registrar like Namesilo or Namecheap, then purchase your web hosting from a provider like Siteground or Bluehost. Of course don&#8217;t take my work for it and do your own research to find the best web hosting provider that fits your needs.<\/p>\n<p>**TL:DR** \\- GoDaddy will overcharge you and upsell you services that are unnecessary.<\/p>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My mom recently built a website.
