Introduction<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>In the modern digital world there are various platforms which a person can utilize to find a job, such as LinkedIn for the professional network, or social media platforms like Reddit sub-forums groups.<\/p>\n<p>There are also other places where a user can seek for professional advice (like dev.to, stackexchange, etc) instead but they are not specialized in producing blockchain content and job research.<\/p>\n<p>The problem that arose in these platforms is they are not full featured in helping recruiters in finding a candidate, or the candidate himself to find a job, nor offer any incentive for sharing users to share their own skills since they are either focused only on the recruitment, or on the skill sharing without direct returns for the content creator. <\/p>\n<p>There is also no way to capitalize on the skills of users nor to show them in an ordered manner to attract more job offers.<\/p>\n<p>It is about having either a completely lax approach like on r\/forhire, which doesn\u2019t have an efficient way of sorting or filtering job proposals, or a rather strict approach like on LinkedIn, which does work for many traditional jobs, but not for web3\/blockchain jobs, where titles and one own background or connections don\u2019t give the full picture of their actual skills and difficulty in paying with cryptocurrencies because of still unsettled legal and tax issues etc.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, the digital world and most of its platfomrs are not moving fast enough to use blockchain techs fully and mostly using the old methods.<\/p>\n<p>So the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.codenjobs.com\/\">Code&amp;Jobs<\/a> team designed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.codenjobs.com\/hiring\">a network to help recruiters, business and blockchain startup owners<\/a> to find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.codenjobs.com\/forhire\">skilled professionals, and the candidates in search for a job<\/a> that suits them to find it, while letting them have a way to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.codenjobs.com\/blogs\">share their experience and skills<\/a> in a more complete blockchain user friendly way. <\/p>\n<p>We believe that having a network designed from the ground up to host especially blockchain related and cryptocurrency paying job offers and serving as a community can offer a unique approach to job recruitment and skill sharing for crypto industry.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"2-the-platform\" href=\"#2-the-platform\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  2. The platform<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>Our website address is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.codenjobs.com\">codenjobs.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>It is serving thousands users monthly, and has several features:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Blogging<\/strong>, intended to serve as backbone of community building, allowing people to share their skills by producing walkthroughs and guides, or share a piece of information in an article. <\/p>\n<p>This feature is free to use.<\/p>\n<p>We intend to hire more professional writers to produce educational material for new blockchain users, and to kickstart the interest towards this part.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Job posting<\/strong> with the chance to filter jobs based on broad categories (e.g. programming, blockchain, marketing, etc), type (full time, part time, free lance, contract, internship), company, salary, location, skills and method of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.codenjobs.com\/jobs?&amp;pay_in_cryptocurrency=true\">payment<\/a> (fiat or crypto). <\/p>\n<p>The feature for posting jobs will be possible to use by spending our token, Solana or other stable token at our platform.<\/p>\n<p>Researching and filtering jobs posted at our website is free of charge.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Profiles<\/strong>, with the ability to filter possible candidates and search among the users who optionally provide their information at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.codenjobs.com\/forhire\">our \/forhire<\/a> page. It is also possible to decide not to share your information and participate in the community growth and use our services.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Direct messaging system<\/strong> is to help the recruiters, tcandidates and normal users to connect privately with each other . You will be also able to trade NFTs we will publish and the market for them and other digital products directly with another user without need for leaving our platform with this feature.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/codenjobsbot\">A Telegram bot<\/a> built with <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/teloxide\/teloxide\">Rust Telegram bot framework Teloxide<\/a>, used to provide support to new users discovering our network, and to help them navigate through our channels of information by using various commands to interact with and find a job as fast as possible without need for visiting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.codenjobs.com\/jobs\">\/jobs<\/a> page from our website.<\/p>\n<p><em>We welcome Rust &amp; Haskell and other low level developers. If you are interested in our website and have a skill for improving it. Feel free to contact us.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Our website Code&amp;Jobs has various features to help both the recruiter and the candidate at the same time, a job seeker can share their skills with a blog post, their profile and titles. <\/p>\n<p>Our users can also share their portfolios all in the same page, being able to passively show their skills and reach more efficiently the recruiters without any need for sharing the same links all the time.<\/p>\n<p>The recruiters can also contact candidates with a direct message, browse their profile, jobs and posts in an ordered manner, by filtering them on our site or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.codenjobs.com\/job\/post\">post a job with our the form<\/a> with a Solana smart contract for it we are preparing to use with our token.<\/p>\n<p>We plan to include a resume that users can allow who can read, a review review previous history, reputation, referral system and more features to help job candidates and recruiters.<\/p>\n<p>We also plan to hire qualified writers and content creators ourselves to bootstrap our educational contents and to help new crypto users to learn how to use blockchain and its relevant techs,. <\/p>\n<p>We will also focus on Solana at the beginning since this is the platform where we deployed our token and have a lot of benefits such as speed, low fee, helpful and fast developing ecosystem and experienced and well thought development experience behind it.<\/p>\n<p>With the adoption of blockchain techs, we will have a job posting system to receive cryptocurrencies as payment methods including our token. <\/p>\n<p>We are in the process of upgrading our platform to more web3 capabilities. <\/p>\n<p>We allow users to use their Solana NFTs for their profiles. We will produce NFTs by paying artists, then we will build an NFT market so users can trade the NFTs for profile image and other services we will provide.<\/p>\n<p>We will also deploy a decentralized exchange on the platform with Solana or ETH variants later to allow users to trade their tokens directly without need for leaving our website and have a mean to sustain our service without depending only on the token.<\/p>\n<p>We will also hire more professional developers and UI\/UX designers to enrich and improve our site experience and developing our roadmap objectives and timelines.<\/p>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"3-project-tokenomics-amp-token-listing\" href=\"#3-project-tokenomics-amp-token-listing\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  3. Project Tokenomics &amp; Token Listing<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>To facilitate the job posting with cryptocurrency and to make the system more crypto user oriented, we decided to mint a token of our own, using <strong>Solana<\/strong> network to deploy it because of its protocol capabilities and lot of benefits. <\/p>\n<p>We use Solana because of its speed and low fee. It will be the best way to use our service blockchain techs.<\/p>\n<p>Any wallet that can hold Solana SPL tokens can send, receive or hold our token as well.<\/p>\n<p><em>The goal of introducing $CODE is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between participants who interact within the Code&amp;Jobs Ecosystem without any intermediaries such as centralized third party entity\/institution\/credit.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Contract address<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/solscan.io\/token\/Code7hV6DaK5Werof8c7vPwBxLvhmEWVUbU2AfhBZArB#markets\">Code7hV6DaK5Werof8c7vPwBxLvhmEWVUbU2AfhBZArB<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Symbol<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>CODE<\/p>\n<p><strong>Decimals<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>6<\/p>\n<p><strong>Total Amount of tokens in circulation<\/strong> &#8211; 10,000,000,000.00<\/p>\n<p>We will use <a href=\"https:\/\/raydium.io\/liquidity\/?ammId=DLPtB6V8sT4bbEdMwbnVPe13PMX8vsgmuD2ENbjYPxGn\">https:\/\/raydium.io\/<\/a> as our first listing tool and you will be able to trade it starting from 2022-02-24 18:00:00 UTC.<\/p>\n<p>Part of the sales will be allocated on product development, marketing, legal counseling, day to day operations, contingency fund, and interaction with investors.
