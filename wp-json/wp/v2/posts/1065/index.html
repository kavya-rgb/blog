It can be deemed as a preliminary check before the build goes for testing.<\/p>\n<p>Sanity testing is performed after a stable build is received and testing has been performed. It can be deemed as a post-build check, to make sure that all bugs have been fixed. <\/p>\n<p>It also makes sure that all functionalities are working as per the expectations.  <\/p>\n<p>Let us first take a quick look at the details of both types of testing, and then we can move onto identifying the differences between them. There is a thin line between them, and people tend to confuse one for another.<\/p>\n<p>What is smoke testing?<\/p>\n<p>smoke testing<\/p>\n<p>Smoke testing, also known as build verification testing, is performed on initial builds before they are released for extensive testing. <\/p>\n<p>The idea is to net issues, if any, in the preliminary stages so that the QA team gets a stable build for testing, thus saving a significant amount of effort and time spent by the QA.
