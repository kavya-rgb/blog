Over the last couple of months, I&#8217;ve noticed a bashing of Fiverr, and upWork in how they&#8217;re trash for developers. And these comments are partially right. For the average developer, you&#8217;ll get out quoted by sellers from third world countries, and finding work will be a real struggle. You have no reviews, yet you want to charge a decent amount &#8211; which is fair. Everyone should be paid for what they&#8217;re worth. That&#8217;s why you try not to be an average developer.  <\/p>\n<p>My story with Fiverr started a number of years ago. At the time, I had very basic experience with WordPress, and I was hired by a friend to build them a website for their new shop. Sure I only got paid \u00a3200, but at the time, it was more than enough, as I learnt that I really enjoyed working with websites. Said friend was buying graphics off Fiverr, and asked me why I don&#8217;t offer my services on Fiverr. At the time, he thought I was a really experienced developer \\~ I was not. He was under this impression since I was always the tech guy people would come to.  <\/p>\n<p>So, I signed up to Fiverr offering bug fixes for wordpress. It was mostly basic stuff like plugins not working, theme errors etc. I was basically uploading\/changing files and getting paid. Getting paid $5. Yes $5 is what I charged. Why you ask? Because I had no reviews, and I knew reviews were key to success on this platform. It took months, of maybe two reviews a week, to build up a profile of around 40-50 reviews. I then upped my price to $15. Sales actually started to increase when I upped my price.  <\/p>\n<p>Eventually after 100 reviews, I started charging $25\/hour. I would price up a job on how long I would think it would take, and do it. If it went over, I wouldn&#8217;t ask for me. It&#8217;s my fault for not accurately predicting how long it would take. Clients really liked this, and would often return.<\/p>\n<p>Despite everything I&#8217;ve said above, I do believe my success came from how I setup my profile. I clearly mention I&#8217;m from the UK, and a small intro about how I got into development, and how I don&#8217;t just do it because it&#8217;s a job, but because I enjoy it. This seems to resonate with people. They seem to want to have an experience with me, than a cheaper worker in another country because we&#8217;re able to connect on a level more than just a job, and they don&#8217;t want the risk of the brief not being understood, and then having to find another seller. 60% of my buyers are in the UK.<\/p>\n<p>When applying for jobs in the buyer requests section, I won&#8217;t post a generic reply. I will always start it with &#8220;Hey there, I&#8217;m Josh. I&#8217;m a developer from the UK&#8221; &#8211; and then I&#8217;ll go into details on how I will solve their job. I&#8217;ve received so many jobs by doing this. But it gets to a point that I don&#8217;t have to do buyer requests because I have so much work on, that I don&#8217;t need any more.  <\/p>\n<p>At this point, I&#8217;ve been working full time on Fiverr for around 2 years. Making good income. I enjoy the freedom of being able to work when I want, how many hours I want. And a client who I have done some wordpress work for, offers me a full-time job in his company of 100+ employees, with a salary 1.5 of the area in my area. The work is with a language I have minimal experience with, and it would take me a good while to get up to date &#8211; yet the client who offered me this job says this is fine. And I totally believe this is down the relationship I built with them.   <\/p>\n<p>So now I&#8217;m leaving my work at Fiverr, and switching to working remote for a company full time, and it feels great. It feels great knowing I won&#8217;t have to work with WordPress again. Sure there is a lot of money with wordpress, but it&#8217;s shite having to deal with websites that weren&#8217;t built by developers, but by normal people dragging and dropping. Using plugins for basic stuff. I don&#8217;t think I ever want to return to working with WordPress.<\/p>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve been a member of this subreddit for quite a while, and I&#8217;ll often reply to threads in my spare time.
