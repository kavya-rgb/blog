One way I imagine it could be done would be to have one central messageRouter component in the main thread that maintains open channels with all the goroutines serving the sockets. This component can then receive the messages and route them appropriately. However, keeping open channels in idle time seems way too costly to me, considering it&#8217;ll have to constantly listen on all the channels.<\/p>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Basically, what the title says.
