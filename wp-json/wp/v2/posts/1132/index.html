But a couple more items sit in the middle of these two; the lesser know <code>Map<\/code> and <code>Set<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>Designed to make data access faster and simpler, you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find a coding challenge site that doesn\u2019t involve at least one of these (typically <code>Map<\/code>) on more than a few of their challenges.<\/p>\n<p><code>Map<\/code> and <code>Set<\/code> share some things, so let\u2019s kick things off with <code>Map<\/code>.<\/p>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"map\" href=\"#map\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Map<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>A <code>Map<\/code> is a key-value store (much like an array), that will allow you you to use just about anything you want as a key, maintains insertion order, has a size property, and rejects duplicate keys. Now that\u2019s a lot of features right there, so let\u2019s look at a basic example first:<\/p>\n<p>Straight away you can begin to see the performance advantages of a <code>Map<\/code>. No more looping through massive data-sets to find what you need, just call <code>Map.get()<\/code> and you\u2019re done! The classic example for a good <code>Map<\/code> is often a phone-book, and that makes sense, because you can imagine how efficient it is to call upon any random contact from a phone-book using a <code>Map<\/code>, which knows each and every entry in there by heart.<\/p>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"keys\" href=\"#keys\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Keys<br \/>\n<\/h3>\n<p>But <code>Map<\/code> is also incredibly versatile. Unlike arrays, it\u2019ll let you use just about whatever you want as a key, whether it be strings, integers, objects, or even functions!<\/p>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"looping\" href=\"#looping\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Looping<br \/>\n<\/h3>\n<p><code>Map<\/code> will also retain their insertion order, which is incredibly important when you want to know what came first. Now of course, <code>Map<\/code> isn\u2019t an array, so you can\u2019t call <code>mapName[0]<\/code> to get the first entry (as <code>0<\/code> is a valid key for a <code>Map<\/code>!), so you might be wondering why insertion order matters?<\/p>\n<p>Well, <code>Map<\/code> also come with a variety of methods you\u2019ll find familiar from <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.to\/duncanmcardle\/battle-of-the-javascript-for-loops-for-forin-forof-foreach-etc-4lae\">my post on for loops<\/a>, such as <code>Map.values()<\/code> , <code>Map.keys()<\/code> , <code>Map.entries()<\/code> and the infamous <code>forEach<\/code> , all of which benefit from the original data being in the order it was inserted.<\/p>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"duplication\" href=\"#duplication\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Duplication<br \/>\n<\/h3>\n<p>Finally it\u2019s worth pointing out another helpful <code>Map<\/code> function: <code>Map.has()<\/code> . This is a simple utility for checking whether a given key already exists in a <code>Map<\/code>, and can therefore be used to avoid overwriting existing data (which <code>Map<\/code> will absolutely allow!):<\/p>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"set\" href=\"#set\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Set<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve discussed <code>Map<\/code> , <code>Set<\/code> is actually super-simple. Think of <code>Set<\/code> as being a <code>Map<\/code> without the keys. So all values, no keys. Simple!<\/p>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"duplication\" href=\"#duplication\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Duplication<br \/>\n<\/h3>\n<p>The beauty of this is that it\u2019s a very straightforward interface for dumping data that will retain its insertion order. But one really powerful aspect is that it will not allow data to be non-unique. This means that if you have a 10,000 item data set, and you insert it all into a <code>Set<\/code>, what you\u2019ll be left with will all be unique. In addition, <code>Set<\/code> does (like <code>Map<\/code>) implement <code>.has()<\/code> , but this time around you\u2019ll be checking if the <code>Set<\/code> has a <em>value<\/em>, rather than checking if a <code>Map<\/code> has a <em>key<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re suddenly thinking back to the last time you did a coding challenge, and realising this would have been super helpful, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve all been there.<\/p>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"looping\" href=\"#looping\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Looping<br \/>\n<\/h3>\n<p>Just like with <code>Map<\/code>, <code>Set<\/code> has a number of helpful methods for iteration. You can use <code>Set.keys()<\/code> , <code>Set.values()<\/code> and <code>Set.entries()<\/code> , as well as the classic <code>Set.forEach()<\/code> . Though if you\u2019re sitting there thinking \u201cWait, what keys, and what entries?\u201d, you\u2019d be right. In order to keep <code>Map<\/code> and <code>Set<\/code> close together in terms of spec, these additional functions have been provided, but in reality, they all return the same thing (or in some cases, two versions of the same thing!):<\/p>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"communal-functionality-clear-and-delete-\" href=\"#communal-functionality-clear-and-delete-\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  Communal functionality ( .clear() and .delete() )<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>In addition to the communal functionality and similarities already listed, both <code>Map<\/code> and <code>Set<\/code> also implement <code>clear()<\/code> (which will completely empty out the contents) and <code>delete()<\/code> (which will remove a specific entry (by key for <code>Map<\/code> and by value for <code>Set<\/code>)).<\/p>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"when-to-use-map-amp-set\" href=\"#when-to-use-map-amp-set\"><br \/>\n  <\/a><br \/>\n  When to use Map &amp; Set<br \/>\n<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you know <em>how<\/em> to use these wonderful data structures, you might be wondering <em>when<\/em> to use them. Well the simple answer is: for data-sets (as the name suggests).<\/p>\n<p>For <code>Map<\/code> , the power of <code>.get()<\/code> is truly incredible. Being able to dump massive amounts of data into a <code>Map<\/code> and then be able to call upon the entry you need without looping is incredibly useful, and comes without the overhead and complexities of the classic Object.<\/p>\n<p>For <code>Set<\/code>, my personal favourite feature (and one I alluded to earlier) is being able to guarantee a unique set of data. This is logic that would normally be difficult and time consuming, but <code>Set<\/code> just\u2026 does it!<\/p>\n<p>As with all of these modern constructs, it\u2019s all about using the right tool for the job, so I hope now that you\u2019ve read this article, you\u2019ll feel just a little bit better equipped to make that decision.<\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In JavaScript, objects are wonderfully versatile, and arrays are wonderfully fast.
