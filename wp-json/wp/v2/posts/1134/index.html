Back then however you had to hope someone had a bootleg of Visual Basic, even then you had no real way to learn it.  At least not the way you can learn today.<\/p>\n<p>Back in 2020, I found Udemy.  At the time I needed to learn Adobe InDesign and Photoshop.  From there I found an Intro to Coding course.  I enjoyed it so I explored it more. I then took a course in web development and eventually I found myself venturing into the realm of game development.<\/p>\n<p>Since I am a complete noob and I wasn&#8217;t learning for a current or new job I spent the last year or so exploring different venues.  Today I am beginning to settle in.  My current areas of study are Python, C#, HTML, and CSS.  I&#8217;m using Visual Studio 2022 and the WordPress environment which is actually for my current job.<\/p>\n<p>I blog about my journey to become an indie game developer on my website <a href=\"http:\/\/d24indiegames.com\/journey\/\">D24 Indie Games<\/a>.  The blog has been an essential tool in helping me continue forward.<\/p>\n<p>Happy to be here on DEV and looking forward to taking my coding journey to the next level.<\/p>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wow, I feel immense pressure writing this first post.
