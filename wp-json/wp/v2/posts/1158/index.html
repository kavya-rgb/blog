Benefits of Agile:-<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It increases the speed of development, testing, and deployment cycles. Instead of waiting for the whole application to get developed.<\/li>\n<li>Here each feature gets tested, deployed.<\/li>\n<li>There is immediate feedback if there are bugs or deployment doesn&#8217;t work &amp; so on.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An Agile Methodology allows for a more dynamic, fast, &amp; easily changeable development and deployment process. And Agile is just a methodology or framework that says what are the good practices and efficient ways to do things. It has specific implementations like Scrum &amp; another one Kanban. Depending on company requirements it would use one of them.<\/p>\n<p>The main takeaway is Agile at the core is the heart of the Continuous Integration &amp; Continuous Delivery process which has become so popular that the company strives towards in order to make its software development &amp; delivery processes much more efficient.<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/practicaldev\/image\/fetch\/s--PkoawAC6--\/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880\/https:\/\/dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\/uploads\/articles\/qaphgvbsdaas3ycsl0xd.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/practicaldev\/image\/fetch\/s--PkoawAC6--\/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880\/https:\/\/dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\/uploads\/articles\/qaphgvbsdaas3ycsl0xd.png\" alt=\"Agile DevOps\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\"\/><\/a><br \/>And the Agile methodology introduction or adoption by companies has supported the need for DevOps tasks.
