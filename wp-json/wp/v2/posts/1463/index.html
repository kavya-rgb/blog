This site allows for users to either add their own recently played games  to the library and receive feedback from others. If they do not feel like participating in the addition of a game they can always use the application to see what is the most popular game<br \/>and the general consensus around this game. <\/p>\n<p>While creating this web application, I found myself dealing with a majority innerHTML and scope. This was due to the function that I wanted for the front of the game cards. I wanted the front of the game cards to only show the image that was added with a button. This button then flips the card allowing for the the rest of the information of the card to show.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/i.giphy.com\/media\/yeNqGMU6tjiswoVE3O\/giphy.gif\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https:\/\/i.giphy.com\/media\/yeNqGMU6tjiswoVE3O\/giphy.gif\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" data-animated=\"true\"\/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Getting the card to this format did take a lot of work and getting familiar with how innerHTML works within the scope. This ultimately came down to creating one function with  2 more functions nested within.<code>renderGame(game)<\/code>,<code>function backCard()<\/code> and <code>function createCardButton()<\/code><\/p>\n<p>The <code>renderGame(game)<\/code> function is the main function that allows for my code to take in the information and post it to the JSON an then allowing for the cards to render on the DOM.<\/p>\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>function renderGame(game){\n    let frontGameCard = document.createElement('div')\n    const frontHTML = `\n      &lt;div class = \"container\"&gt;\n      &lt;img class = \"gamePic\" src=\"https:\/\/dev.to\/kale_leach\/${game.imgurl}\"\/&gt;\n      &lt;button id = \"btn_${game.id}\" class=\"btn\"&gt; ${game.name} &lt;\/button&gt;\n      &lt;\/div &gt;`\n      frontGameCard.className=\"front_card\"\n      frontGameCard.id = `card_${game.id}`\n      frontGameCard.innerHTML = frontHTML\n\n        contClass.appendChild(frontGameCard)\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode<\/title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"\/>\n<\/svg><\/p>\n<p>    <svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode<\/title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"\/>\n<\/svg><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>This inforamtion is gathered from an earlier function that calls on render game. This information then is taken and added to our <code>createCardButton()<\/code>. This function allows for each card to have its own function button that allows for users to click on each card. The main issue that I ran into here was that if the cards had all the same ID with a <code>.document.querySelector(#x)<\/code> only the first button would have functionality, leaving the rest  useless. To bypass this issue I had to set the ID of the cards to <code>btn_${game.id}<\/code>. This gave each card their own unique ID allowing for each button to work separately.<\/p>\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>function backCard(){\n    frontGameCard.innerHTML = \n      `&lt;div class = \"container\"&gt;\n      &lt;div class=\"column\"&gt;\n      &lt;h2&gt; ${game.name} &lt;\/h2&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt; ${game.description} &lt;\/p&gt;\n      &lt;div id = 'sys_price' class=\"grid\"&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt; System &lt;\/p&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt; Price &lt;\/p&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt; ${game.systems}&lt;\/p&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt; $${game.price}&lt;\/p&gt;\n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      &lt;div class=\"grid\"&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt; &lt;span id = 'num-of-must'&gt; ${game.must_play} &lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt; \n      &lt;p&gt; &lt;span id = 'num-of-play'&gt; ${game.play} &lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt; &lt;span id = 'num-of-return'&gt; ${game.return} &lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt; \n      &lt;button class=\"Must_Button\"&gt; Must Play &lt;\/button&gt; \n      &lt;button class=\"Play_Button\"&gt; Play &lt;\/button&gt; \n      &lt;button class=\"Return_Button\"&gt; Return &lt;\/button&gt;\n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      &lt;button class = back_btn&gt; Back &lt;\/button&gt;\n      &lt;\/div\"&gt;` \n<\/code><\/pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode<\/title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"\/>\n<\/svg><\/p>\n<p>    <svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode<\/title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"\/>\n<\/svg><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>This then led me to my second nested function <code>function backCard()<\/code> which when the button on X&#8217;s card was clicked it would replace the image of the card with rest of the information. This is where I dealt with a majority of the scope issues. At first I tried creating the function outside of the <code>renderGame(game)<\/code> function but quickly learned that in order for this function to use any of the information required to be built, it had to be inside of <code>renderGame(game)<\/code>. This function responds to the click <code>cardButton.addEventListener('click', backCard)}<\/code> changing the innerHTML from the function scope of <code>renderGame(game)<\/code>. The final capability of my cards that was required so the application could keep its aesthetic was a back button. This allowed for the user to flip that card back over and stay on their search for their next game.<\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I recently just finished my first project, which is a simple video-game library with a quick and easy rating system.
